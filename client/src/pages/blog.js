            ASSET TOKENIZATION DEFINITION
            <br />
            Asset tokenization involves representing the ownership rights of
            real-world assets as digital tokens on a blockchain.
            <br />
            Key Takeaways:
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Asset tokenization has the potential to bring trillions of
                dollars of real-world value onto blockchain networks
              </li>
              <li>
                Tokenized assets benefit from permissionless liquidity, open
                access, on-chain transparency, and reduced transactional
                friction compared to traditional assets
              </li>
              <li>
                Tokenized assets require high-quality off-chain data from secure
                and reliable Chainlink oracles
              </li>
            </ul>{" "}
            “Asset tokenization” is a term for the use of smart contract and
            blockchain technology to represent ownership or rights to an asset
            as a tradable, on-chain token. Though it most commonly refers to the
            tokenization of financial or fungible assets, such as shares in a
            company or a quantity of gold, asset tokenization can hypothetically
            refer to the tokenization of anything possessing monetary value. As
            such, asset tokenization is among the most promising use cases for
            blockchain, with the upper bound of asset tokenization market size
            potentially encompassing nearly all of human economic activity—a
            dollar number estimated to be worth well over a hundred trillion
            annually. As anyone familiar with the oracle problem knows, any
            instance where a Web3 application needs to interact with the
            external world can present security risks and other complications,
            and asset tokenization—a process that by nature relies on
            information about the world that is generally off-chain—is no
            exception. Secure oracles are key for asset tokenization to reach
            its full potential, as markets need reliable information about the
            underlying assets in several key processes such as minting, trading,
            managing, and more.

            <h1 className="primaryText">What Is Asset Tokenization?</h1>
            Digital asset tokenization is the process whereby ownership rights
            of an asset are represented as digital tokens and stored on a
            blockchain. In such cases, tokens can act like digital certificates
            of ownership that can represent almost any object of value,
            including physical, digital, fungible, and non-fungible assets.
            Because they’re stored on a blockchain, owners can maintain custody
            over their assets (if owners are holding them in their own secure
            crypto wallet). If the long-term promise of this use case is
            impressive, so too are the strides toward adoption already being
            made today. Major enterprises, such as Boston Consulting Group and
            ADDX, BlackRock, Deloitte, BNY Mellon, and EY, have studied asset
            tokenization and concluded that it possesses the capacity to disrupt
            multiple industries, including the global securities industry.
            Additionally, Microsoft and Vanguard have announced or gone live
            with projects tokenizing industrial assets and securities,
            respectively. By these metrics, asset tokenization is already among
            the most popular blockchain use cases currently achieving real-world
            enterprise adoption. To understand how asset tokenization works and
            why it matters, let’s revisit the basics of Web3 technology: Smart
            contracts are cryptographically secure digital agreements created
            with computer code and stored on a highly secure type of database
            known as a blockchain. In order to issue tokens, a developer writes
            a smart contract on a blockchain that maps positive balances to a
            series of wallet or smart contract addresses, along with functions
            that enable users in control of those addresses to add and subtract
            from those balances. Asset Tokenization Examples
            <br /> Real-world asset tokenization—Real-world assets like fiat
            currency, equities, T-bills, credit, commodities, carbon credits,
            intellectual property, and fine art can be tokenized and stored on a
            blockchain. Similar to gold bullion warrants and house deeds,
            they’re bearer assets that give the holder a claim over a real-world
            asset. The key difference from legacy bearer assets is that physical
            asset tokenization enables assets to be stored, traded, and used as
            collateral across blockchain networks.
            <br /> ‍ Digital asset tokenization—Tokenizing assets that only
            exist in a digital form on a blockchain network is critical to Web3,
            especially for use cases such as representing DAO governance rights
            and cross-chain assets. Because they’re entirely digital, tokenized
            assets stored on a blockchain enable the owner to hold the asset
            outright, rather than owning a claim on the underlying asset. <br />{" "}
            In-game asset tokenization—A subset of digital asset tokenization,
            in-game assets used in GameFi projects or metaverses, such as skins,
            weapons, or in-game currencies, can be represented as tokenized
            assets.

            <h1 className="primaryText">Benifits of Asset Tokenization</h1>
            POTENTIAL BENEFITS The decentralized standard system for land
            registration records will reduce the role of intermediaries,
            decrease the time and cost of the process and the system will
            strengthen the process and will build the trust between the
            transacting parties. Recording rights of property through Blockchain
            will help in annual cost savings and provide tamper-proof ledger
            book. Blockchain usually reduces the expenditure and time of
            registration process and will help Judiciary to settle down most of
            the civil cases related to property. The benefits of using
            Blockchain in land registry system summarized in the following
            points:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Transparency: Every node has a complete overview of transactions
                and holds a history of the transactions that can be visible from
                anywhere at any time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increased trust: Trust build due to immutable record keeping and
                verification of data at multiple nodes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increase predictive capability: History information stored at
                multiple nodes can be traced back, that increases the predictive
                capability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reliability: Data is stored in multiple places in the blockchain
                based system. Consensus mechanisms ensure that only information
                changes when all relevant parties agree.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increased control: Consensus mechanism to add transaction
                increases the control over the database.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cost reduction: Cost decreases as no human third party involved
                in conducting and validating the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduced energy consumption: Increased efficiency and transaction
                mechanisms through network reduces the energy consumption.
              </li>
              <li>
                Security: Data is stored at multiple systems using encryption
                methods that stop the data from being altered without proper
                authentication.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ease of access: Information stored at multiple nodes, enhances
                easy and speedy access.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ease of access: Information stored at multiple nodes, enhances
                easy and speedy access
              </li>
              <li>
                Privacy: The information must be secure from secret
                surveillance. Users need secret keys or access mechanism to
                ensure that the information is safe from unauthorized view.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reducing corruption: Distributed ledgers storage allows for
                preventing corruption in land ownership due to the secure and
                reliable mechanism of transfer and changing ownership records
              </li>
              <li>
                Error reduction: Automated transactions reduces chances of
                errors done by humans.
              </li>
              <li>
                Data integrity and higher quality: Not accessed by hackers or
                unauthorized users mean the originality of the data maintained.
              </li>

              The Need for Oracles in Asset Tokenization
            </h1>
            <br />
            While asset tokenization has the potential to enhance the utility of
            a wide variety of real-world assets and simultaneously buttress
            growth and innovation within the DeFi space, it is also a use case
            whose functionality is highly reliant on secure oracles. In order
            for something of monetary value to be accurately represented and
            traded on the blockchain, there must be good information on the
            asset. This need is especially acute at four stages in a tokenized
            asset’s life cycle: when the tokens are created, when they are used
            as collateral, when users check their valuations, and when they are
            sold on secondary markets.
            <br />
            Chainlink Proof of Reserve
            <br />
            Tokenized asset projects can use a decentralized verification
            service, Chainlink Proof of Reserve, to help relay this off-chain
            information on-chain. Chainlink PoR provides unparalleled
            transparency into off-chain collateral, helping enhance the security
            and verifiability of tokenized assets. By using Chainlink PoR’s
            decentralized verification mechanism to relay collateralization
            data, tokenization projects can demonstrate a new level of
            transparency and security.Leading tokenization projects are already
            utilizing or integrating Chainlink Proof of Reserve to help relay
            off-chain valuation data on-chain, including:
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                OpenEden for tokenized T-bills ‍<br />
              </li>
              <li>
                Backed Finance for tokenized equities‍
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                TUSD and Poundtoken for tokenized fiat currency
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Fortunify for tokenized credit‍
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                Cache Gold for tokenized gold
                <br />
              </li>
            </ul>
            Some tokenization projects are using Chainlink PoR in an additional
            way—for providing cryptographic guarantees that new tokens minted
            are backed by reserves, thereby helping to prevent infinite mint
            attacks. TUSD, Poundtoken, and Cache Gold are using Chainlink PoR
            Secure Mint in their minting smart contract to help ensure reserves
            are sufficient before minting new tokens.
            <br />
            Different assets will necessitate different oracle network
            structures and needs. Depending on the use case, Chainlink oracles
            can provide direct valuations to assets or serve as benchmarks for
            making decisions on them. Since Chainlink interoperates with any API
            and off-chain system, Chainlink oracles are able to source this data
            from multiple avenues, such as professional data providers (e.g.
            Kelly Blue Book for cars), independent/expert appraisers,
            exchanges/OTC markets, or any customized aggregation of data sources
            to create a single trusted valuation. This can be supported by a
            decentralized network of independent Chainlink nodes that call
            off-chain APIs to retrieve data or the data providers/appraisers can
            run Chainlink oracles themselves to relay data directly to smart
            contracts.
            <br />
            In order to further preserve the integrity of the network and
            maintain a high degree of data quality, unique crypto-economic
            incentives can be bootstrapped on to the oracle network. Methods
            like staking-backed service agreements and immutable reputation
            systems are able to track the historical quality of the valuations
            provided by appraisers, nodes, data providers, and more. This
            framework will incentivize accurate valuations as dishonest
            valuations will be financially penalized and their reputation score
            lowered, hindering their ability to earn future revenue as a data
            provider. It will also allow even niche and esoteric assets which
            rely on expert appraiser information to enter into the tokenized
            market while maintaining stronger crypto-economic guarantees that
            the valuation data is sound.
            <br />
            Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)
            <br />
            Some tokenized assets need to be interoperable across different
            computing environments to access a broader pool of liquidity and a
            larger number of users across different platforms and ecosystems.
            The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is designed to help
            eliminate the need for developers to write custom code for building
            chain-specific integrations and help make native cross-chain
            tokenized assets.

            <h1 className="primaryText">Conclusion</h1>
            Though still in its early stages, asset tokenization is one of the
            most exciting and highest ceiling use cases for blockchain
            technology. However, without robust and secure oracles like
            Chainlink, tokenization will be limited in the value it can produce
            on-chain and be subject to centralization risks, which cuts into the
            very value proposition it was designed to create. Only by deploying
            Chainlink decentralized oracles to access real-world information
            will this promising technology reach its full potential of bringing
            added value to any asset around the world.
